<strong>1889 Baist Atlas Map of Richmond, Virginia</strong>
<p>The interactive atlas allowed for in-depth contextual exploration of each Richmond geographic area mapped by Baist via Points of Interest (POI). POIs contained information about selected panel points, revealed historical images juxtaposed with present-day Google maps and provided links to related VCU Digital Collections. Users could select the images to further explore VCU collections. The historical images did not depict 1889 Richmond, but did represent Richmond in the 19th and 20th century.</p>
